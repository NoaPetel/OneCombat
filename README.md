*⚠️ This project was created as part of a study project at Polytech Grenoble with a strict deadline. The current state reflects the version submitted for evaluation ⚠️*

<br/>

This project is a **fighting game** inspired by the *One Piece* universe. It combines sprite-based animations and game mechanics controlled by **state automata**. Players (or AI) face off using characters from the world of *One Piece*, each with their own unique animations and attack patterns.

2. Watch as your character, controlled by state automata, battles opponents.
3. Each character's animations are governed by a set of predefined states (idle, attack, defend, etc.).
4. Win the match by outlasting your opponent in combat.
